## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document lists the requirements for DevPulse: the MVP (incident CRUD REST API) and the Beta (authentication, role-based access control, team assignment, and security), deployed on Vercel.

### 1.2 Scope
- **MVP:** a client can create, list, view, update and delete incidents over HTTP. There are no accounts; all incidents are maintained in one shared system list.
- **Beta:** engineers sign up and log in, view their assigned incidents, share incident workflows through teams, and administrators manage users and roles.
- Out of scope: see [PRD, section 5](01-prd.md#5-scope).

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| CRUD | Create, Read, Update, Delete |
| REST | API style where resources (like `incidents`) are accessed with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) |
| Incident | An IT or software issue report containing a title, description, severity level, status, and assignment data |
| Personal incident | (Beta) An incident assigned to or created by a specific user |
| Team | (Beta) A named engineering unit (e.g., DevOps, Core Backend) with members and a shared incident scope |
| Team incident | (Beta) An incident belonging to a team context and visible to all its members |
| RBAC | Role-Based Access Control: what a caller can execute based on their system role |
| JWT | JSON Web Token: a signed token proving the identity of the caller |
| Access token | (Beta) Short-lived JWT sent in the `Authorization: Bearer` header |
| Refresh token | (Beta) Long-lived random token stored in an HttpOnly cookie, used to acquire new access tokens |
| Client | Anything calling the API: the React frontend, `/api/docs`, curl, Postman |
| OpenAPI | Standard API description; FastAPI generates it automatically at `/api/docs` |

### 2.2 Users and roles

| Role | Release | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous client | MVP | Anyone reaching the API; full access to the shared incident list |
| Guest | Beta | Unauthenticated; can sign up, log in, check health status, and read API documentation |
| Software Engineer (SE) | Beta | Core contributor; reports incidents, updates working status, and views assigned tickets |
|Lead Engineer (LE) | Beta | Technical lead; handles incident triage, priority adjustments, and task delegation |
| Administrator (Admin) | Beta | System admin; dashboard metrics, user listing, role assignment, user banning, and system-wide overrides |
| Team Lead | Beta | Per-team role for the user who created the team: manages team settings and membership |
| Team Member | Beta | Per-team role: view, create, and update team-scoped incidents |

Software Engineer, Lead Engineer, and Admin are global system roles. Team leadership and membership are per-team contexts.

Role permissions follow a strict hierarchy: Lead Engineers inherit all capabilities of Software Engineers, and Administrators possess full administrative and operational oversight across all system resources.

### 2.4 Constraints
- C-1: Runs on Vercel serverless functions (no local disk that survives between requests).
- C-2: Backend in Python 3.10+ with FastAPI.
- C-3: All API routes start with `/api`, because `vercel.json` sends `/api/*` to the backend.
- C-4: Requests and responses use JSON.
- C-5: Production database is Supabase PostgreSQL; local development uses SQLite.
- C-6: (Beta) Login is implemented in our own API (no third-party login providers).

### 2.5 Assumptions
- A-1: A hosted database is available to the Vercel project through an environment variable.
- A-2: The app is used for demos and class work, so traffic is low.
- A-3: (Beta) The first admin is promoted manually in the Supabase table editor.
- A-4: (Beta) MVP tasks are demo data and may be removed when tasks get an owner.

## 3. Functional requirements

### 3.1 Tasks — MVP

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | The system shall create a task from a JSON body with `title` (required), `description`, `due_date` (optional). New tasks have `is_completed = false`. | MVP | US-01 |
| FR-02 | The system shall return the list of tasks, newest first. | MVP | US-02 |
| FR-03 | The list shall support `offset` (default 0) and `limit` (default 20, max 100) query parameters. | MVP | US-02 |
| FR-04 | The system shall return one task by its ID. | MVP | US-03 |
| FR-05 | The system shall update any of `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `is_completed` on an existing task. Fields not sent stay unchanged. | MVP | US-04, US-05 |
| FR-06 | The system shall delete a task by its ID. | MVP | US-06 |
| FR-07 | The system shall set `created_at` when a task is created and update `updated_at` on every change. | MVP | US-04 |
| FR-08 | The system shall reject invalid input with status `422` and a message saying which field is wrong. | MVP | US-07 |
| FR-09 | The system shall return `404` when a task ID does not exist. | MVP | US-07 |
| FR-10 | The system shall expose `GET /api/health` returning `{"status": "ok"}`. | MVP | US-08 |
| FR-11 | The system shall publish interactive API docs at `/api/docs`. | MVP | US-07 |

### 3.2 Authentication and profile — Beta

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-12 | The system shall let a guest sign up with `email`, `name` and `password`. Email is unique (case-insensitive); a duplicate returns `409`. New users get role `user`. | Beta | US-09 |
| FR-13 | The system shall log a user in with email and password, returning an access token in the body and setting a refresh token cookie. Wrong email or password returns `401` with the same message for both. | Beta | US-10 |
| FR-14 | The system shall issue a new access token when called with a valid refresh token cookie, and replace (rotate) the refresh token. | Beta | US-10 |
| FR-15 | The system shall log a user out by revoking the refresh token and clearing the cookie. | Beta | US-10 |
| FR-16 | The system shall return the logged-in user's profile (`id`, `email`, `name`, `role`). The password hash is never returned. | Beta | US-10 |
| FR-17 | In the Beta, every task, group, user and admin endpoint shall require a valid access token; otherwise it returns `401`. | Beta | US-11 |
| FR-40 | A user shall be able to change their own `name`. Email and role cannot be changed through the profile. | Beta | US-23, US-24 |
| FR-41 | A user shall be able to change their password by sending the current and the new password. A wrong current password returns `400`. On success all the user's sessions (refresh tokens) are revoked and they log in again. | Beta | US-24 |

### 3.3 Personal tasks — Beta

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-18 | A task created through `/api/v1/tasks` shall belong to the caller (personal task). The list returns only the caller's personal tasks. | Beta | US-11 |
| FR-19 | Reading, updating or deleting another user's personal task shall return `404`, so the task's existence is not revealed. | Beta | US-11 |

### 3.4 Roles (RBAC) and admin — Beta

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-20 | Every user shall have exactly one global role: `user` or `admin`. | Beta | US-12 |
| FR-21 | An admin shall be able to list all users (paginated). | Beta | US-12 |
| FR-22 | An admin shall be able to change another user's role. An admin cannot change their own role (`400`), so the system always keeps at least one admin. | Beta | US-12 |
| FR-23 | An admin shall be able to list all tasks (personal and group) and delete any task. | Beta | US-13 |
| FR-24 | A non-admin calling an admin endpoint shall get `403`. | Beta | US-12, US-13 |
| FR-35 | An admin shall be able to view dashboard stats: total users, admins, banned users, new users in the last 7 days, total / completed tasks, tasks created in the last 7 days, and total groups. | Beta | US-20 |
| FR-36 | An admin shall be able to ban a user with an optional reason. Banning revokes all the user's refresh tokens. An admin cannot ban themself or another admin (`400`); demote the admin first. | Beta | US-21 |
| FR-37 | A banned user shall get `403` ("Account banned") on login and on every authenticated request, even with an access token that has not expired yet. | Beta | US-21 |
| FR-38 | An admin shall be able to unban a user; the user can then log in again. The user's tasks and group memberships are kept while banned. | Beta | US-22 |
| FR-39 | The admin user list shall show each user's status (`active` / `banned`), ban date and ban reason. | Beta | US-21 |

### 3.5 Groups and group tasks — Beta

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-25 | Any user shall be able to create a group with a `name`. The creator becomes the group's `owner`. | Beta | US-14 |
| FR-26 | A user shall be able to list the groups they belong to. | Beta | US-14 |
| FR-27 | The owner shall be able to rename or delete the group. Deleting a group deletes its tasks and memberships. | Beta | US-14 |
| FR-28 | The owner shall be able to add a member by email. Unknown email returns `404`; an existing member returns `409`. | Beta | US-15 |
| FR-29 | The owner shall be able to remove a member. A member shall be able to leave. The owner cannot leave (they delete the group instead). | Beta | US-15, US-18 |
| FR-30 | Group members shall be able to list, create, view and update the group's tasks. | Beta | US-16 |
| FR-31 | A group task may have an `assignee_id`, which must be a member of the group (`422` otherwise). When a member leaves or is removed, their assigned tasks in that group become unassigned. | Beta | US-17 |
| FR-32 | A group task can be deleted by its creator or by the group owner. | Beta | US-16 |
| FR-33 | A user who is not a member of a group shall get `404` for that group and its tasks. | Beta | US-16 |

### 3.6 Account security — Beta

| ID | Requirement | Release | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-34 | After 5 failed logins in a row for an email, the system shall block logins for that account for 15 minutes and return `429`. A successful login resets the counter. | Beta | US-19 |

### 3.7 Validation rules

| Field | Rule | Release |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Required on create, string, 1–200 characters after trimming spaces | MVP |
| `description` | Optional, string, max 1000 characters | MVP |
| `due_date` | Optional, date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format | MVP |
| `is_completed` | Boolean | MVP |
| `offset` | Integer ≥ 0 | MVP |
| `limit` | Integer 1–100 | MVP |
| `email` | Valid email, max 254 characters, stored lowercase | Beta |
| `name` (user) | 1–100 characters | Beta |
| `password` | 8–128 characters | Beta |
| `name` (group) | 1–100 characters | Beta |
| `role` | `user` or `admin` | Beta |
| `reason` (ban) | Optional, max 500 characters | Beta |
| `assignee_id` | Optional; must be a member of the task's group | Beta |

### 3.8 Task states

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: POST /tasks
    Pending --> Completed: PATCH is_completed=true
    Completed --> Pending: PATCH is_completed=false
    Pending --> [*]: DELETE
    Completed --> [*]: DELETE
```

A new task always starts as `Pending` (`is_completed = false`). Editing other fields does not change the state. The same states apply to personal and group tasks.

### 3.9 Permission matrix — Beta

| Action | Guest | User | Group member | Group owner | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sign up, log in | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Log out, view own profile, change own name and password | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| CRUD own personal tasks | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Read/update another user's personal task | No | No (`404`) | No (`404`) | No (`404`) | Read only (via admin list) |
| Delete any task | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| List users, change roles | No | No (`403`) | No (`403`) | No (`403`) | Yes |
| View dashboard stats, ban / unban users | No | No (`403`) | No (`403`) | No (`403`) | Yes (not self, not other admins) |
| Create a group | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| View group, members and group tasks | No | No (`404`) | Yes | Yes | No (`404`) unless member |
| Create / update / assign group tasks | No | No (`404`) | Yes | Yes | No (`404`) unless member |
| Delete a group task | No | No | Own tasks only | Yes | Yes (admin endpoint) |
| Rename / delete group, add / remove members | No | No | No (`403`) | Yes | No |
| Leave group | No | — | Yes | No (delete instead) | — |

"User" means a logged-in user who is not a member of the group in that row.

### 3.10 Status codes

| Case | Code | Release |
|---|---|---|
| Resource created | `201 Created` | MVP |
| Read or update succeeded | `200 OK` | MVP |
| Deleted / logged out | `204 No Content` | MVP |
| Validation failed | `422 Unprocessable Content` | MVP |
| Resource not found, or caller may not know it exists | `404 Not Found` | MVP |
| Unexpected server error | `500 Internal Server Error` | MVP |
| Bad request (e.g. admin changing own role) | `400 Bad Request` | Beta |
| Missing, invalid or expired token; wrong login | `401 Unauthorized` | Beta |
| Logged in but role not allowed, or account banned | `403 Forbidden` | Beta |
| Duplicate (email taken, already a member) | `409 Conflict` | Beta |
| Too many failed logins | `429 Too Many Requests` | Beta |

## 4. Non-functional requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | Performance | 95% of task requests answer in under 500 ms (excluding a cold start). | MVP |
| NFR-02 | Persistence | Data is stored in a database and is not lost on redeploy or restart. | MVP |
| NFR-03 | Availability | The production API is reachable on the Vercel URL during the semester. | MVP |
| NFR-04 | Security | All traffic uses HTTPS (provided by Vercel). | MVP |
| NFR-05 | Security | Database credentials and secrets are stored only in Vercel environment variables, never in Git. | MVP |
| NFR-06 | Security | Database queries use the ORM with parameters, never string-built SQL. | MVP |
| NFR-07 | Security | Error responses do not expose stack traces or database details. | MVP |
| NFR-08 | Maintainability | Code is split into layers: routes, schemas, models, database. | MVP |
| NFR-09 | Usability (API) | Every endpoint is listed in `/api/docs` with request and response schemas. | MVP |
| NFR-10 | Deployability | The app runs on Vercel; a push to `main` updates production. | MVP |
| NFR-11 | Security | Passwords are hashed with Argon2; plain passwords are never stored, logged or returned. | Beta |
| NFR-12 | Security | Access tokens are JWTs signed with a secret of at least 32 bytes from an env var, valid for 15 minutes. | Beta |
| NFR-13 | Security | Refresh tokens are random, valid for 7 days, stored only as a hash, and replaced on every refresh. | Beta |
| NFR-14 | Security | The refresh token cookie is `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` and limited to path `/api/v1/auth`. | Beta |
| NFR-15 | Security | Frontend and API share one origin, so CORS stays disabled (no cross-origin access). | Beta |
| NFR-16 | Security | Responses include security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`. | Beta |
| NFR-17 | Security | Every permission check runs on the server for every request; the frontend hiding a button is never the only protection. | Beta |
| NFR-18 | Performance | Sign up and login answer in under 1 s (password hashing is slow on purpose). | Beta |
| NFR-19 | Maintainability | Database schema changes are made through Alembic migrations, not by hand. | Beta |
